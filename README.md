### Someone who inspire me
Nonso Martin. Someone I met online that have become my friend. The guy is very cool and laughs a lot. What's special about him and separate him from the rest is that he codes in a phone. But even with a phone Martin has learned more than anyone would guess.

He has done so much that every time I have self-doubt I think of him and remind myself that hard work and dedication can bring success.
